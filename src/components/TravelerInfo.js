        <h1>Travel Information</h1>
        <p>
          Having a pleasant flight begins before you arrive at the airport. Be
          better prepared for your flight by knowing what to expect. Before you
          pack, check out the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/">
            Transportation Security Administration
          </a>{" "}
          (TSA) policies, procedures, and guidelines for air travel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your airline is the best source of information about luggage sizes and
          restrictions, check-in procedures, scheduled arrival and departure
          times, destinations, fees, and ticket prices. For airline contact
          information, visit our <a href="/airlines">Airlines page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSM offers ample parking for travelers. Visit the{" "}
          <a href="/parking">parking page</a> for real-time parking

        <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Download the airline app.</strong> Download the airline
            mobile app to use for easy check-in; plus, airlines use their app to
            send flight notifications to update their passengers. Many airlines
            allow you to rebook directly through the app if your flight is
            canceled.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pack Smart.</strong> If you have your boarding pass on your
            phone and you are traveling with a carry-on suitcase you can save
            time and bypass the need to stop at the ticket counter or kiosk. Be
            sure to follow all TSA carry-on luggage rules, including the liquids
            and gels rule of 3-1-1. If you opt to check a suitcase, arrive at
            least 90 minutes before your departure and verify airline ticket
            counter hours to ensure you can check your bag.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Arrive Early.</strong> All passengers should plan to be at
            the airport at least 90 minutes before their scheduled departure.
            This will give you time to park, check-in, and process through
            security.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Enroll in TSA PreCheckâ„¢ or Customs & Border Protection's Global
              Entry Program.
            </strong>{" "}
